      them inside of a paragraph. I did that in the hopes that they'd end up along the

      see the whole page-->

  <!--Both above and below this, I've used the anchor tag extensively. Probably too much haha,
       but I did that to include links to the actual IMDb website, and well as some creative
       applications to get the smaller (2017) just below in my h1 element. The search bar
       I messed around with a bit, but could never find out how to extend like the bar in the
       website proper.-->

<h4>Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi <i>(original title)</i></h4>
  <!--So above and below I use the h4 and h6 tags respectively. I did this to achieve the smaller syles of the
      other headings inside of the website. I think they both ended up looking pretty good, and I even included
      the links into the h6 below.-->

<!--Just above I had difficulty getting the image in, and then realized it'd probably take some CSS to get the
    text to align properly as in the original website. As this assignment had been mainly focusing on Semantic
    HTML, I chose to forgo that hassle. Under here I wrote out the directors (etc.) of the movie. As I'd
    already extensively used the anchor tag, I decided to only have the link to the full cast and crew seen
    below.-->

  <!--Moving on here I had the basic header and text introducing the next images/video. The included video
      was obviously not on the website. I added it as I knew how to embed Youtube videos, but not
      their video. The images were good practice, but again, the spacing was troubling. I made sure they all
      were on a new line, and left it with text next to the images/video.-->
